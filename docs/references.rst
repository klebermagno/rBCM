Related References
===================

Here are some interesting links I found helpful during this project.

Work done by `Marc Deisenroth`_ and his student `Jun Wei Ng`_ in the
following proceedings paper was the primary reference used during the
implementation:

* `Distributed Gaussian Processes <distributed_gaussian_processes_>`_

These slides are useful as a quick and visual explanation of the rBCM and
related models:

* `Powerpoint slides on Robust Bayesian Committee Machines <pp_deck_on_rbcm_>`_

`Volker Tresp`_ has research going back a couple decades in this area. On his
`website <Volker Tresp_>`_, search for keywords 'committee machine' and
'gaussian process' in the page to find the relevant papers. Here are some:

* `Background information on (Non-robust) Bayesian Committee Machines <bcm_backround_info_>`_
* `The Generalized Bayesian Committee Machine <generalized_bayesian_committee_machine_>`_
* `Mixtures of Gaussian Processes <gp_mixtures_>`_
